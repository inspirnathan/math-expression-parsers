# Part 5
Code for [Part 5](https://inspirnathan.com/posts/153-math-expression-tokenizer-in-javascript/) of my math expression parser series at [inspirnathan.com](https://inspirnathan.com)

## Commands
* `node for-loop/example`: Run example code for printing tokens using a tokenizer built with `for` loops.

* `node for-of-loop/example`: Run example code for printing tokens using a tokenizer built with `for...of` loops.

* `node regex/example`: Run example code for printing tokens using a tokenizer built with regular expressions. This type of tokenizer will be used or referenced for the remainder of my tutorial series.
